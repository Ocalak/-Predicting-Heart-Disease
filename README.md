# 🫀 Predicting Heart Disease – A Guide to Any Classification Problem

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to solving classification problems using a real-world dataset: **Heart Disease Prediction**. It walks through the entire machine learning pipeline, from data exploration to model evaluation, making it a great resource for both beginners and intermediate practitioners.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore a dataset
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Apply various classification models
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and more
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters



## 📁 Files

- `A_Guide_to_any_Classification_Problem.ipynb`: The core notebook containing the entire workflow.
- `heart.csv`: (If included) The dataset used for predicting the presence of heart disease based on clinical features.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes medical attributes such as:
- Age
